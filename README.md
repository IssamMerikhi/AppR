# EasyViz

EasyViz is a little App which provides the user to see all the import data he might have. Launch your biz !!!

The App : [EasyViz](https://issammerikhi.shinyapps.io/easyviz/)

# Documentation

EasyViz is your new little business technology. If you want to clearly and **EASYLY** look and understand your data you just have to **_UPLOAD your CSV file_** naviguate accros the categories :


- Density
- Heatmap
- Histograms
- Network

Exercises are computed with random coefficients which provides the user an infinite of exercises. No need to prepare classes _ANYMORE_.
Graphs have been made with plotly. They are _interactives_. The user can see more informations by _hovering graphs_.

## Usage

The App has been made the simplest possible. The user must opload his data and then plays with the categories to choose the graph we want to show.

As example, the user can upload his CSV file via the upload button. Once the data loaded, the user can plays with differents types of visualisation.
To respect the spirit of a simple and friendly user project, I don't had button to choose range for interval and other kind of stuff.
For the tutorial, I displayed the well known iris dataset.
